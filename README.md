# Neural Network From Scratch (NumPy Only)

This project implements a simple feed-forward neural network **from scratch**
using only NumPy (no deep learning frameworks).

The network is trained on a small 2D synthetic dataset for **binary classification**.

## Main Features

- One hidden layer with ReLU activation
- Softmax output layer for multi-class probabilities
- Cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent with backpropagation
- Vectorised NumPy implementation
- Visualisation of the learned decision boundary
